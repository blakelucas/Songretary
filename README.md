# Songretary

Songretary is a music processing application designed to assist with the creation of music on the go. The three main functions of this application are a tuner, metronome (including haptic feedback), and a transcriber, which records played notes on a musical staff.

Songretary is a collaborative final project created by three Appalachian State University students, Blake Lucas, Phillip Lavey, & Darian Silvers. This project was completed over the course of the Spring 2023 semester as the final project for the Capstone course.
