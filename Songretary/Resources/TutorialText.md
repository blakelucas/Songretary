Welcome to Songretary! This application was built by three Appalachian State University seniors as their final project. Songretary was built over the course of about 4 months.

Songretary currently has 4 main functions: A tuner, metronome (including BPM detection), transcriber, and settings. Navigate through the Views using the Navigation Bar at the bottom of the screen. Each tab brings you to a different function (View) of the application.

Tuner: Simply open the Tuner tab and begin tuning your instrument. The large tick mark in the middle represents the closest note to your current pitch.

Metronome: The Metronome starts at 120BPM. Click the 'Start' button at the bottom of the screen to begin the metronome. Press and drag up and down to change the tempo. Click 'Stop' to stop the metronome. Haptic Feedback can be turned off in Settings. If you are encountering issues with the sounds, ensure that your Ringer is turned on before opening the app.

Transcriber: Turn your audio into sheet music. Use the record button to begin transcribing audio. Once finished recording, press stop to display the transcipted sound. After finishing a session, press clear to reset the stave.
