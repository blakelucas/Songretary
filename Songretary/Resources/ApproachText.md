Songretary was built over the course of January 2023 to May 2023 as a final Capstone project. None of us had dabbled in iOS development, so this project was a good way for us to learn this avenue of development. 

Each of us developed one of the functions of the application, with Blake developing the Tuner, Phillip developing the Metronome, and Darian doing the Transcriber. Each of us tweaked portions of the UI.
